Short Description: Diff appears to hang in long file


Long Description:

Running the "diff -bBw" command on a very large input file (eg 250 MB), in a multi-byte locale (ie UTF-8), took a very long time to complete, if at all. In a reported case, a diff ran for multiple days and did not complete. In certain situations, this could cause 100% CPU usage.
